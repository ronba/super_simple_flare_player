A basic flutter project to allow exploring the different type of animations contained in a FLR file.  
Purposely kept small and very simple. 

All you need to do is:
1. Add flares into assets/flares.
2. Run the flutter project.

Motivation: I got a flare file and did not know which animation to use :)
